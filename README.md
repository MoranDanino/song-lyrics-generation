# Song Lyrics Generation by Genre with the approach of using GPT-2 fine-tuning: 
The purpose of the project is to build models that are able to 
generate song lyrics depending on genre (specifically, rap songs and pop songs).
All code for my project was written using the Python language in the Google Collab 
environment. In all the files I needed to use the function "High ram" in the Google 
Collab and in some I used GPU.
